    **What I Offer:**
    - **Product Strategy:** Together, we'll get crystal clear about your vision, identify your target users, and validate that we're building something with genuine market demand.
  
    - **Tech:** Typescript, Python, Rust, Docker, React.JS, Tailwind, Figma.
  
    - **User & Developer Friendly Design:** My development ethos is based on simplicity: for the end-user a minimal and easy to understand user experience that also prioritizes speedy development time.

    - **Launch & Growth:** Launch day is just the beginning. We'll work together to get those first users buzzing about your product and keep that momentum going.

    - **Iteration:** We'll keep our ears on the ground, listening and gathering user feedback. Then we'll continue working together to make it more awesome.
