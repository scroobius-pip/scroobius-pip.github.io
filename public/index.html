            One thing I really love about design is how small details can subtly shape people's experiences. It's not
            merely about aesthetics; it's about hitting that sweet spot where everything feels just right.

            This is why I find joy in crafting playful micro-animations, fine-tuning the perfect spring animation, and
            humanizing interactions to reflect genuine human intentions. Think about it—it's often the little things
            that make your day!
