Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.\nSomething was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.\nBut as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.\nAll of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/long-long-man/","title":"Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Man","description":null,"body":"\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.
